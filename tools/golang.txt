What is golang
- Golang is a programin glanguage which is statically typed, is a simple and supports concurrent programming using goroutine and channels.

Main featuers in golang:
- simple
- complies faster
- supports concurrecny
- garbage collection

purpose of defer:
- defer is used to execute at the end of the function
- is used for closing(channels) or files ( this works even after an error)

closure functions:

is a fucntion which has access to variables from outer function.
This makes them especially useful in concurrent programming, where multiple goroutines may need to access shared state. 
By using closures to encapsulate the shared state, you can ensure that each goroutine only modifies the state in a controlled way.
